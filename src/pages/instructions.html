        <p>
          The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer
          to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length
          and separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,
          from the Italian word for 'tomato'!
        </p>
        <h2>It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3!</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Take some time to think about the time each of your tasks are going to
          require.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          After you press “Show Timer”, you’ll be asked to input the amount of
          time that you decided earlier and we’ll break down your work sessions
          into the appropriate pomodoro intervals!
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          After you’re done with one full task you’ll see a popup that asks you
          to enter the amount of pomodoro intervals that task actually ended up
          taking!
