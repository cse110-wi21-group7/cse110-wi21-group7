### What did you work on yesterday?
Yesterday I came up with a better file structure for our project but it may not be worth implementing because I have now decided that it might be better to merge a few of our scripts once those are complete.

There are no blockers as of this moment.

### What will you work on today?
Today I'll rewatch the lecture where the project was introducted to us (Jan 25th/Jan29th) to get a better understanding of the final requirements for the project (especially in terms of whether we're shooting for a finished product or just a polished engineering process).
