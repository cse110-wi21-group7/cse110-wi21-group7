### What did you work on yesterday?
Nothing, because yesterday was a break

### What are your blockers?
None.

### What will you work on today?
Today I'll work on cleaning up the repo even more so there's little less merge conflicts than we're having right now. *EVERYONE* pull from master / your super branch frequently

### How close are we to hitting our sprint goals?
We'll probably make our goals because we're meeting again this week.

### What did you work on yesterday?
- I divided the tasks to complete the styling for the Timer Page with Farheen & Elaine.

### What are your blockers?
- It is taking some time to get the branch set up with all recent changes and the build pipeline, but I will resolve it with Uposhanto today.

### What will you work on today?
- I will set up the branch to work on our task for the sprint.

### How close are we to hitting our sprint goals?
- If Farheen, Elaine, and I complete our styling tasks for the Timer Page, we should be good to hit our sprint goals for my task.
